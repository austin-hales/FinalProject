## Everything You Need to Know About WiFi


### Intro
    
Despite the many things that can be done through WiFi, it is fairly simple. It is essentially done with two radios, that use lower power and broadcast over a shorter distance than a car stereo, communicating back and forth.


### How Data is Sent
As a result of Wifi sending data by way of radio waves, it’s subject to interface from other Wifi signals, radio waves, or even cement walls. To counteract the interference, Wifi uses two frequencies 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz. 2.4 gigahertz is the lower frequency so it can reach computers farther away, but 5 gigahertz offers the capacity to carry more transmissions. Wifi can broadcast on both frequencies allowing the signal to cut through all the interference to deliver a fast strong signal from your wireless router to your device. 

But ever since the age of cordless phones, people have had problems with radio signals crossing. The issue continues today with neighbors and their Wi-Fi networks. One way to get around this is by setting your frequency to broadcast on a certain channel. Most routers are good at automatically detecting the best channel to use. And 5 gigahertz networks have many more channels than networks broadcast on the 2.4 gigahertz frequency, another reason to use the new standard, if you can.

Many people have issues with their connection speed so to fix this problem they turn to network extenders. However, fine-tuning their network is a better idea because network extenders just repeat signals. So if the extender is receiving a faint signal, the extender will only repeat that same weak signal.

### Security Features
Wi-Fi also has a number of security features. To access the network, users must have a password for WPA2, also known as Wi-Fi Protected Access (the 2 represents the fact that this feature is in its second generation). This is where you put in your password to get onto the Wi-Fi network. There’s another security feature called Advanced Encryption Standard (better known as AES) that was developed by the U.S. government to keep data safe as it transmits from one device to the other. Every piece of data that goes over Wifi is encrypted and only the two parties involved understand it.

## Backwards Compatiability
One of the most overlooked features of WiFi is its backwards compatability. This is how old computers are able to connect with new, super-fast routers. Routers that are produced today work with devices that were produced in 2000.

## Components of WiFi

### IP Address
All computers on the Internet use the TCP/ IP protocol as the standard for how to communicate on the network. In the TCP/ IP protocol, IP addresses are used as a unqiue identifier.

All Computers with IP addresses have an IPv4 address
* IPv4 uses 32 binary bits to create a single unique address on the network. An IPv4 address is expressed by dots. Each number is the decimal (base-10) representation for an eight digit binary (base-2) number, also called an octet
* IP addresses can be dynamic or static. Static addresses are configured by a user on your computer’s network settings. Dynamic addresses are assigned by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), a service running on the network.
* Dynamic IP addresses are issued using a leasing system, which means that the IP address is only active for a limited time. If the lease expires, the computer will automatically request a new lease

### Wireless Router

The router is a central location that all computers and other devices connect to, providing the devices with network access. The router manages wireless connections and also helps connect your wireless network to the Internet. Despite it’s name, wireless routers almost always have one or more Ethernet port. One of the ports is used to connect the router to a broadband modem. Some broadband routers include an integrated modem as a single hardware unit

Routers have three main functions:
1. Routers separate networks into sections, or bridge different networks together
2. They assign IP addresses using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
3. Firewall and Protect
    They filter messages or keep users out of private networks. Most routers have a Firewall built in. This is a software function that keeps unwanted messages from reaching the computers on the inside, or private part of the network.
    
#### Computer Firewalls
Computers using Windows XP (or newer) then you also will have a firewall on your computer
A computer's firewall is less secure than the one built into your router but it is normal to leave it enabled on your computers
Upon installation, some applications will change the firewall settings

### Modem

Hardware device that allows computer to send and receive data over a telephone line, cable or satellite connection. When using an analog telephone line, the modem converts data between analog and digital formats in real time for two way network communication. High speed digital modems that are more common today, the signal is simpler and doesn’t require an analog to digital conversion. External modems plug into a home broadband router or other gateway device on one end and the external internet interface such as a cable line on the other. The router directs the signal to all devices connected to it as needed.
